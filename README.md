# FHIR Artifact repository

## TODO:


;; deps management

;; canonicals table with package_id
;; package_deps (all deps ids + level)
;; canonical_deps table with source (canonical_id), type and path and url/version

;; after providing list canonicals
;; we can resolve all deps
;; and make uber-package with everything inside

;;as well we can check that all deps are resolvable

First do it for SD, VS

SD deps:
- baseDefnition
- type
- binding
- reference

VS
- codesystem
- valueset
